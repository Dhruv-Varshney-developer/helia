## 1.0.0 (2025-10-08)


### � BREAKING CHANGES

* `ipns.publish` now accepts key name strings rather than private keys Names previously publishing using an user controlled private key, will need to be explicitly published again by first importing the key into the keychain (`await libp2p.keychain.importKey('my-key', key)` and then published with `ipns.publish('my-key', ...)`.

### Features

* add ipns reproviding/republishing ([#764](https://github.com/Dhruv-Varshney-developer/helia/issues/764)) ([008747b](https://github.com/Dhruv-Varshney-developer/helia/commit/008747b59a03682e1b6f648a39635e1b1971e481))

## [9.0.0](https://github.com/Dhruv-Varshney-developer/helia/compare/interop-v8.3.0...interop-v9.0.0) (2025-10-08)


### � BREAKING CHANGES

* `ipns.publish` now accepts key name strings rather than private keys Names previously publishing using an user controlled private key, will need to be explicitly published again by first importing the key into the keychain (`await libp2p.keychain.importKey('my-key', key)` and then published with `ipns.publish('my-key', ...)`.
* car.stream has been renamed car.export
* uses libp2p v3 and updated block/data stores
* Fields that would involve DAG traversal have been removed from the output of `fs.stat` - pass the `extended` option to have them returned
* helia now uses libp2p@2.x.x
* requires @helia/interface@4.1.x or later, `resolveDns` has been renamed `resolveDNSLink`
* to support paths in `@helia/ipns`, the return type of `ipns.resolve` is now `{ path: string, cid: CID }` instead of just `CID`
* remove gossipsub from default libp2p services ([#401](https://github.com/Dhruv-Varshney-developer/helia/issues/401))
* `helia.routing` is the default routing used, the `libp2p` routing has been removed as it is redundant
* the `libp2p` property has been removed from the `Helia` interface in `@helia/interface` - it is still present on the return type of `createHelia` from the `helia` module
* uses multiformats v13 and helia v3
* uses multiformats v13 and helia v3
* uses multiformats v13 and helia v3
* uses multiformats v13 and helia v3
* uses multiformats v13 and helia v3
* uses multiformats v13 and helia v3, renames `dht` routing to `libp2p`
* uses multiformats v13
* uses multiformats v13 and helia v3
* `helia.pin.add` and `helia.pin.rm` now return `AsyncGenerator<CID>`
* alters the options object passed to the `ipns` factory function
* The libp2p API has changed in a couple of places - please see the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/main/doc/migrations/v0.46-v1.0.0.md)
* the `IPNSRecord` type returned from the `publish` method has changed
* libp2p has been updated to 0.46.x

## [9.0.0](https://github.com/Dhruv-Varshney-developer/helia/compare/interop-v8.3.0...interop-v9.0.0) (2025-10-08)


### � BREAKING CHANGES

* `ipns.publish` now accepts key name strings rather than private keys Names previously publishing using an user controlled private key, will need to be explicitly published again by first importing the key into the keychain (`await libp2p.keychain.importKey('my-key', key)` and then published with `ipns.publish('my-key', ...)`.
* car.stream has been renamed car.export
* uses libp2p v3 and updated block/data stores
* Fields that would involve DAG traversal have been removed from the output of `fs.stat` - pass the `extended` option to have them returned
* helia now uses libp2p@2.x.x
* requires @helia/interface@4.1.x or later, `resolveDns` has been renamed `resolveDNSLink`
* to support paths in `@helia/ipns`, the return type of `ipns.resolve` is now `{ path: string, cid: CID }` instead of just `CID`
* remove gossipsub from default libp2p services ([#401](https://github.com/Dhruv-Varshney-developer/helia/issues/401))
* `helia.routing` is the default routing used, the `libp2p` routing has been removed as it is redundant
* the `libp2p` property has been removed from the `Helia` interface in `@helia/interface` - it is still present on the return type of `createHelia` from the `helia` module
* uses multiformats v13 and helia v3
* uses multiformats v13 and helia v3
* uses multiformats v13 and helia v3
* uses multiformats v13 and helia v3
* uses multiformats v13 and helia v3
* uses multiformats v13 and helia v3, renames `dht` routing to `libp2p`
* uses multiformats v13
* uses multiformats v13 and helia v3
* `helia.pin.add` and `helia.pin.rm` now return `AsyncGenerator<CID>`
* alters the options object passed to the `ipns` factory function
* The libp2p API has changed in a couple of places - please see the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/main/doc/migrations/v0.46-v1.0.0.md)
* the `IPNSRecord` type returned from the `publish` method has changed
* libp2p has been updated to 0.46.x

## [9.0.0](https://github.com/Dhruv-Varshney-developer/helia/compare/ipns-v8.2.4...ipns-v9.0.0) (2025-10-08)


### � BREAKING CHANGES

* `ipns.publish` now accepts key name strings rather than private keys Names previously publishing using an user controlled private key, will need to be explicitly published again by first importing the key into the keychain (`await libp2p.keychain.importKey('my-key', key)` and then published with `ipns.publish('my-key', ...)`.
* uses libp2p v3 and updated block/data stores
* helia now uses libp2p@2.x.x
* requires @helia/interface@4.1.x or later, `resolveDns` has been renamed `resolveDNSLink`
* to support paths in `@helia/ipns`, the return type of `ipns.resolve` is now `{ path: string, cid: CID }` instead of just `CID`
* remove gossipsub from default libp2p services ([#401](https://github.com/Dhruv-Varshney-developer/helia/issues/401))
* `helia.routing` is the default routing used, the `libp2p` routing has been removed as it is redundant
* the `libp2p` property has been removed from the `Helia` interface in `@helia/interface` - it is still present on the return type of `createHelia` from the `helia` module
* uses multiformats v13 and helia v3, renames `dht` routing to `libp2p`
* alters the options object passed to the `ipns` factory function
* the `IPNSRecord` type returned from the `publish` method has changed

* `helia.pin.add` and `helia.pin.rm` now return `AsyncGenerator<CID>`
* The libp2p API has changed in a couple of places - please see the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/main/doc/migrations/v0.46-v1.0.0.md)
